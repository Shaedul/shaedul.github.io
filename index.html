<p align=”justify”>I am student of Computer science & Engineering. I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Port City International University, Chittagong, Bangladesh in January 2018. My undergraduate research advisors were Professor Rashed Mustafa and Sr. Lecturer Mrs. Taofica Amrine. I also worked with Associated Professor Mr.Neasarul Haque Shisir and Mr. Samrat Nasir Uddin to develop numerous software. Before that I completed a 4 years Diploma in engineering degree from Bangladesh Sweden Polytechnic Institute, kaptai, Bangladesh. I have successfully completed several MOOCs on Coursera, edX and Stanford Lagunita - some of my certifications can be found at here. I love to learn new things and play and watch soccer. </p>
